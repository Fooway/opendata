# Open Data Standard for Recreational Water Quality
Introducing the open data standard project for automated recreational water quality data exchange. 

In spring 2017 Swim Guide received a grant from the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA.ca) to develop the first ever standard for the automated exchange of recreational water quality data. [Visit our project website for more information.](www.recreationalwater.ca)

We believe an open data standard for recreational water quality is critical. More and more recreational water quality data is being shared openly, yet there is little machine readable data being made available, and when there is, there is virtually no data format interoperability between providers. We need to ensure consistency in the way recreational water quality data is managed in order to promote the free exchange of information. 

# Background 

The stated primary purpose of recreational water quality monitoring in Canada, the US, and around the world, is to protect public health and safety from contaminated water. However, it can be very difficult for the public to get an answer to the question “is is safe to swim?” The data is often difficult to get ahold of, or to interpret; it can be out of date, or simply not publicly accessible. 

Hundreds of counties, municipalities, park organizations and nonprofits regularly test water for indicator bacteria, algae, and/or other harmful pollutants. The data should be shared quickly (within 24 hours) and with as wide an audience as possible in order to help people avoid waterborne illnesses; yet, there is no technical standard for doing so. 

Studies from the Environmental Protection Agency estimate the between 3%-8% of people experience acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) after swimming. An estimated 3.5 million Americans get sick each year. In Canada, the number is approximately 400,000.  Children are the most likely to get sick. Poor disclosure of recreational water quality information 

Since 2011 Swim Guide spends thousand of hours each summer manually compiling water quality information from websites (some using legacy technologies), phone hotlines, spreadsheets so that 1.5 million people can access beach water information. 

Swim Guide, with support of the Canadian Internet Registration Authority, is currently developing the first-ever open standard for automated data exchange of recreational water quality information. 

The open data standard will increase data exchange, improve public awareness of water quality, and aid researchers trying to protect recreational waters. The initiative will reduce the number of people getting sick from contact with polluted water and increase the number of environmental protection plans for communities affected by pollution.
